# CLAUDE.md Template for TypeScript Projects

A template [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) file for TypeScript projects. It includes coding standards, conventions, and patterns I've found helpful when working with AI coding agents on TypeScript codebases.

The template covers:

- Project structure conventions (module organization, file naming)
- Common commands and workflow expectations
- TypeScript/ESM best practices
- Code style preferences (arrow functions, named imports, type guards over assertions)
- Patterns to prefer and anti-patterns to avoid

## Usage

Copy [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) to the root of your TypeScript project and customize for your specific stack and preferences.
